Task 1.

Statically Typed Language: Type checking is done at compile-time. Dynamically Typed Language: Type checking is done at runtime. 
Strongly Typed Language: Strict type checking, variables hold specific types. Loosely Typed Language: Flexible type handling, 
variables can change types easily. Java is Statically Typed and Strongly Typed.


Task2.

Case Sensitive: Differentiates between uppercase and lowercase characters. Case Insensitive: Treats uppercase and lowercase characters as the same. 
Case Sensitive-Insensitive: Context-specific, treating case sensitivity as needed. Java is Case Sensitive.


Task3.

Identity Conversion is a type of type conversion that involves assigning a value to a variable of the
same type, or passing an argument to a method where the argument's type matches the parameter
type exactly.

Example
int number = 42;
int anotherNubmer = number;
long myLong = 151316;
long myNextLong = myLong;

here firstly, a value is assigned to number and that number is assigned to another variable with same type.


Task4.

Primitive Widening Conversion: Safe casting from smaller to larger data types. 
Example:  (byte)→(short)→(int)→(long)
          (float)→(double)


Task 5.

run time constant- the value of the constant is known when the project runs
example
final int Const1 = 10*Math.Random();
compile time constant- the value of the constant is known when the project compiles.
Example
final int Const2 =20;


Task6.

Implicit conversions happens automatically and explicit conversions are not happening
automatically without external forcing (casting the target type at the end ).
conditions to met to happen an implicit narrowing primitive conversion
1. an assigning context
2. a compile time constant
3. within the bit range of target type

Task7.

The but structure if the float is different from long. Even the number of but is lesser, float can store
larger range of values, but with a less accuracy.
